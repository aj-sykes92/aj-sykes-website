      <description>I’ve built a new R package! After nearly a year of rehashing soil carbon modelling code across multiple projects, I finally found the time over the Christmas holidays (when else?) to properly document and contextualise it in a package. I am unapologetically borrowing from the vignette for this new package to form the bulk of this post, since the task of explaining myself intelligently is something I’m lucky to get right once.</description>

      <description>A bit of an accidental blog post, this one. My current side project is a Shiny application for estimating solar panel energy generation potential — I’ll be posting plenty about that when it’s more mature — but for now, I found a neat solution that streamlined a small part of that workflow, and I think it might interest some.
In the past, I’ve used spatial data as the building blocks for many of the models I build, and it’s especially pertinent for solar-based models.</description>

      <description>I thought this would make as good a debut post as any for the new site. Here’s the challenge:
My partner is, like many of us, taking the extended pandemic lockdown/recovery as an opportunity to catch up on some learning — and though I’m lucky enough to be working from home too, I’ve also been looking for ways to feel like I’m doing more than just passing time. As a result, we’ve used our subscriptions budget to sign up to Great Courses Plus, which is essentially geeky version of Netflix, streaming lecture series instead of shows.</description>
