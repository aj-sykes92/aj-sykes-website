      <description>A bit of an accidental blog post, this one. My current side project is a Shiny application for estimating solar panel energy generation potential — I’ll be posting plenty about that when it’s more mature — but for now, I found a neat solution that streamlined a small part of that workflow, and I think it might interest some.
In the past, I’ve used spatial data as the building blocks for many of the models I build, and its especially pertinent for solar-based models.</description>

      <description>I thought this would make as good a debut post as any for the new site. Here’s the challenge:
My partner (the wonderful Aisha Josiah) is, like many of us, taking the extended pandemic lockdown/recovery as an opportunity to catch up on some learning — and though I’m lucky enough to be working from home too, I’ve also been looking for ways to feel like I’m doing more than just passing time.</description>
