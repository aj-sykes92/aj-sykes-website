<p>Communicating environmental data science insights via Shiny applications is just about my favourite part of my job. Given the range of contexts and places in which I’m finding myself building apps, I wanted to maintain a page which keeps up-to-date links to the apps next to a record of the context in which they were built. Here they are:</p>

<h1><em>July 2020</em> | A decision-support tool for agroforestry policymakers</h1>
<p>An add-on to an extended modelling project, this app provides an interactive user interface for some of the most interesting data science I’ve done in a while. This part of the project (part of Defra’s <em>Achieving Clean Growth through Sustainable Intensification</em>) sought to identify the greenhouse gas abatement potential of agroforestry in UK agriculture.</p>

<h1><em>May 2020</em> | A personal project for planning solar panels, pumps and ponds</h1>
<p>My mum recently moved to a new house, retired, and found herself in a months-long Covid lockdown. All of these factors appear to have contributed to an excess of time and enthusiasm for garden landscaping, and she called me at the beginning of May with a request that I (because-science) help her figure out what size of solar panel she would need to support an artificial river between newly-dug ponds at the top and bottom of her garden. The result was a Shiny application that predicted hour-by-hour river flow based on a combination of local environmental data plus user-adjustable solar panel, pump, pond overflow and battery configurations.</p>

<div id="march-2020-a-process-based-model-of-soil-carbon-dynamics" class="section level1">
<h1><em>March 2020</em> | A process-based model of soil carbon dynamics</h1>
<p>The first app I ever made that wasn’t just-for-me, I built this to work with a group of MSc students on a soil modelling tutorial. The group’s range of coding abilities was quite wide, with some pretty experienced, and others very much less so. I actually had them set up and run the app from their own R session, allowing the more confident students full access to the back-end code. The model behind the app was defined in the IPCC’s (2019) refinement to the Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Reporting.</p>
